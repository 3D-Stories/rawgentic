# Rawgentic modernization — campaign log

Rolling design-artifact log for the autonomous workflow-modernization campaign
(dogfood: rawgentic builds rawgentic). One section per implemented slot, updated
in that slot's PR (shared-doc mode). The hand-curated program dashboard lives
separately at `docs/planning/2026-07-04-workflow-modernization-review.html`; this
log is the per-slot artifact the WF2 Step-12 lifecycle renders with embedded
run-record telemetry.

Milestones: **M1** instrument+guard (done) · **M2** enable+restructure (done) ·
**M3** multi-issue autonomy + v3.0.0 (done) · **M4** headless (done — pilot
shipped; live run owner-gated). M1–M4 **COMPLETE**; the **epic #188 fast-follow**
(WF2 hardening + epic-native workflows + OAuth Action reviews) is now in progress.

## Epic #493 — WF2 speed levers (manual drive)

**Status: COMPLETE (2026-07-19, 6/6 merged, epic closed)** — #488 (PR #495, 46ae9b0, v3.58.0); #489 (PR #496, a59096f, v3.59.0); #490 (PR #497, 031e01c, v3.60.0); #491 (PR #498, f01e6bc, v3.61.0); #492 (PR #500, 88f01c0, v3.62.0); #494 (PR #503, 72f1d04, v3.64.0). Suite 3634+10skip → 3695+10skip across the epic, zero regressions. Levers inert for live sessions until owner plugin reinstall + fresh session. Follow-up: #502.
Owner D-5/D-6 (2026-07-18): built BEFORE #475 resumes — #475 (and #467 W4, paused at Task 1
@ 5c1c880) stay paused until this epic merges AND the owner reinstalls the plugin + fresh session.

Per-child WF2 wall-clock levers derived from the epic #475 run-timing profile (~1h52m/child;
review-wait ~20% of wall-clock, much of it orchestrator idle-blocking). All children run the
small-standard lane; the levers are applied MANUALLY while building them (scoped pytest during
iteration, probe-before-design, pipelined reviews). AUTO MODE merge grant (owner, 2026-07-18,
scoped to this run).

### #488 — review-wave pipelining: never idle-wait · v3.58.0

New canonical `<review-pipelining>` block in implement-feature's SKILL.md: after dispatching any
review wave (Step 4 design critique, Step 8a per-task, Step 11 pre-PR), immediately draft the
next phase's non-committing artifact (plan, next task's tests, PR body, version/changelog edits)
and reconcile findings on the wave's return. Hard boundary pinned in the same block: committing,
branching, pushing, and every gate verdict still WAIT — only idle time is reclaimed, no gate
skipped, no verdict pre-empted; a gate finding always wins over a stale draft. Three wave-site
pointers in references/steps.md (§4 item 7 · §8a item 2 · §11 item 2), single-source per the
drift-guard doctrine; guards: `TestReviewPipelining` (canonical sentence, gate-semantics
sentence, ≥3 pointer sites).

- **Lane run:** small-standard (standard_feature, 4 impl files ≤ 7; laneImplExtensions
  markdown-is-product). TDD red (1e6eba0) → green (91f8127); suite 3634+10skip → 3637+10skip.
- **Dogfood note:** the run itself pipelined its own Step 11 — PR body + this section drafted
  while the lane reviewer ran.
- **Reviews:** 1 lane reviewer (opus) + adversarial diff review skipped (no security surface).
  No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.
- PR #495, squash-merged 46ae9b0 (2026-07-19), all 4 CI lanes green.

### #489 — scoped tests during iteration: full suite exactly twice · v3.59.0

New canonical `<test-run-discipline>` block in implement-feature's SKILL.md: FULL suite exactly
twice per run (Step 2 baseline, Step 9 final regression gate); Step 8 iteration runs the SCOPED
suite for the area under change; a scoped run never substitutes for the final full-suite gate.
Documented scoped-path convention (mirror the changed area into the test tree; prose → its
pinning guard file) + two evidence-driven exceptions (Step 12 re-run only on post-Step-9
code/test-pinned commits; invalid baseline re-records). Four steps.md sites amended (§2 baseline
record incl. tree-hash carry rule · §8 item 1 · §9 Part B · §12 item 4); guards:
`TestTestRunDiscipline` (exactly-twice sentence, never-substitutes sentence, ≥3 pointer sites).

- **Lane run:** small-standard (4 impl files). TDD red (b69f3f5) → green (efd504b); suite
  3637+10skip → 3640+10skip.
- **Dogfood note:** baseline carried from #488's final gate by tree-hash identity
  (46ae9b0^{tree} == f452ad7^{tree}) — this child ran the full suite exactly once locally.
- **Reviews:** 1 lane reviewer (opus): 1 Medium fixed-in-gate — the per-task delegation paths
  (steps.md item 3 + 2 restatements) still mandated per-task full-suite runs, contradicting
  exactly-twice; fixed 78d403e. 1 Low band-dropped (0.60 < 0.90). Adversarial diff review
  skipped (no security surface). The fix touched a test-pinned surface post-Step-9, so the new
  Step-12 rule itself mandated the full re-run (3640/10 unchanged) — the exception fired
  correctly on its own shipping PR. No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.
- PR #496, squash-merged a59096f (2026-07-19), all 4 CI lanes green.

### #490 — probe the real platform API before the design · v3.60.0

New canonical `<probe-before-design>` block in implement-feature's SKILL.md: before a design
commits to any load-bearing platform/API behavior, run a SHORT live probe of the EXACT
invocation the design will ship — never a proxy composition — and cite the real result in
`platform_apis:`; a `verified via spike` claim must reference the actual shipped invocation
(#467 post-mortem: two ~25-min design loop-backs traced to proxy-composition spikes). Step 3
platform_apis rules gain probe-before-claim; Step 4 feasibility judgment treats a proxy spike
as blocking; #226 precedent rule untouched. Guards: `TestProbeBeforeDesign` (3).

- **Lane run:** small-standard (4 impl files). TDD red (f973061) → green (8107779); suite
  3640+10skip → 3643+10skip.
- **Reviews:** 1 lane reviewer (opus) + adversarial diff review skipped (no security surface).
  No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.
- PR #497, squash-merged 031e01c (2026-07-19), hard lanes green (advisory code-review still
  running at merge — owner grant gates on test+lint; follow-up noted).

### #491 — model-tier reviewers: sonnet mechanical, strong security · v3.61.0

New `select_review_lens_model` (`hooks/model_routing_lib.py` + CLI `--lens`): WF2 review
dispatches pick the model per lens — `security` PINNED to the resolved review model (config
override ignored with a warning), `mechanical`/`ac_completeness`/`test_coverage`/`bug_logic`
default sonnet via optional `modelRouting.reviewLenses`. Never-Haiku on every path (8a
hardened: entry-point floor). WF2-local `<review-lens-routing>` block carries the lens map;
shared `model-routing-resolve` untouched (WF3 out of scope). 17 routing tests + 3 guards.

- **Lane run:** small-standard; Task 2 riskLevel high (module boundary) → 8a fired,
  dogfooding its own lens map (R1 sonnet mechanical / R2 opus security). 6 findings:
  3 fixed dd48127 (boundary haiku floor — R2's catch; docstring purity; Final[frozenset]),
  3 band-dropped. Suite 3643+10skip → 3663+10skip (+20).
- **Reviews:** 1 lane reviewer (opus, security lens) NO FINDINGS + adversarial diff review
  FIRED (high-risk task, gpt): 3 findings — 2 Medium adopted (5f0f33c: `--lens`
  review-role-only; malformed `reviewLenses` warns), 1 High refuted with evidence
  (inherit = documented dispatch-site-guard contract; ledger d-491-11-1-adv1).
- PR #498, squash-merged f01e6bc (2026-07-19), all 4 CI lanes green.

### #492 — fewer/tighter review waves: one 8a wave, Step 11 to 2 · v3.62.0

Step 8a → ONE accumulated 2-reviewer wave over every high-risk commit (after the last plan
task, before Step 9; per-task coverage preserved via one log entry per task —
`assert_review_coverage` unchanged; blocking point moves to fix-before-Step-9, the named
trade). Step 11 → 2 reviewers (R1 mechanical+bug/logic fast tier; R2 architecture+security
strong — the security lens is never the one dropped). `STEP11_REVIEW_AGENT_COUNT_FULL` 3→2,
one-wave `estimate_agents`, shared-block examples corrected, mirror guards recomputed.

- **Lane run:** small-standard; Task 3 (gate-flow prose) riskLevel high → 8a fired as ONE
  wave, dogfooding the rule it ships. Suite 3666+10skip → 3669+10skip (+3 guards).
- **Reviews:** single 8a wave (sonnet mechanical / opus security) + lane Step-11 +
  adversarial diff review (fires on high-risk task) — results in the PR.
- PR #500, squash-merged 88f01c0 (2026-07-19), all 4 CI lanes green.

### #494 — early smoke-install after first runnable commit (deploy-bearing) · v3.64.0

New canonical `<early-smoke-install>` block in implement-feature's SKILL.md: on a deploy-bearing
project (`capabilities.has_deploy`), after the first runnable commit boots something, run a cheap
live smoke-install/boot check (install / start / health) before continuing implementation —
crash-on-boot and environment/port clashes surface as 2-minute fixes instead of hours-later
cutover surprises (the 3dstories-fleet timing post-mortem's move #2: a Config crash + a mempalace
port clash). Capability-gated: code-only projects (`has_deploy == false`, rawgentic itself)
unaffected — the directive never runs there. Step 8 gains the first-runnable-commit site (incl.
whole-issue-delegation collect-time timing); Step 15 gains a never-substitutes note — the
mandatory post-deploy smoketest is not weakened or replaced. Guards: `TestEarlySmokeInstall`
(canonical sentence, gating sentence, Step-15 distinct + ≥2 pointer sites).

- **Lane run:** small-standard (standard_feature, 4 impl files); 0 high-risk tasks → no 8a
  (mirrors #488–#490). TDD red (f8cf18f) → green (5c9f199); suite 3692+10skip → 3695+10skip.
- **Reviews:** lane Step-11 reviewer (opus, security seat) + adversarial diff review per the
  opt-in — results in the PR.
- PR #503, squash-merged 72f1d04 (2026-07-19), all 4 CI lanes green; Step-11 F1 (Low, band-dropped, verified real) adopted as tightening 6f23f58.

## Standalone — #502: entry signatures for the step-state pointer (owner-ordered, post-#493) · v3.65.0

Born live during #494: the statusline sat on "step 5" through all of Step 8 (small-standard-lane
dead zone — Step 6 skipped, Step 7 marker-less, Step 8's marker appends at step end), and the
owner asked twice. Fix: `_SIGNATURES` rows become `(needle, hit, entry_only)`; `git checkout -b `
stamps branch-cut entry (WF2 S7 / WF3 S6, non-monotonic for same-session follow-up issues) and
`git commit` becomes a monotonic entry stamp (WF2 S8 / WF3 S7 — fires only below the target, so
Step-11/12 commits never regress the pointer). `detect_signature` grows optional `current_step`;
`_step_num` compares off the hot path; ReDoS posture + foreign-session gate untouched (tested).
Completion-time advance stays the #499 design — these are the cheap unambiguous entry stamps its
review anticipated.

- **Lane run:** small-standard (standard_feature, 3 impl files); Task 2 (hot-path hook infra)
  riskLevel high → one 8a wave. TDD red (cf7c94e, 8 failing) → green (530af76, 58 scoped, pylint
  10.00); suite 3695+10skip → 3705+10skip (+10 tests).
- **Reviews:** single 8a wave (sonnet mechanical / opus security) + lane Step-11 + adversarial
  diff review (fires on high-risk task) — results in the PR.
- PR / merge SHA: filled at close-out.

## Standalone — #499: hook-level step-state emission (owner-ordered, mid-#493) · v3.63.0

Born live: the statusline froze twice during the #493 run (manual #480 step-entry writes
skipped under batching). New PostToolUse hook `step_state_post.py` — marker detector
(session-notes DONE markers parsed from the append command's heredoc body) + signature
detector (derive/scan/pr-create/pr-merge/summarize), both writing through the existing
`step_state.py write` CLI; conservative context rules (registry session match; foreign
records never stamped); fail-open, empty stdout. Manual per-step calls now OPTIONAL in
all five skills; the no-gating-hook guard recut + PostToolUse-only registration pin.

- **Lane run:** small-standard; Task 2 (hook+registration) high → single 8a wave
  (sonnet mechanical / opus security). 14 hook tests + 1 registration guard.
- PR / merge SHA: filled by the next slot's pass.

## Epic #475 — orchestrator/executor wiring: WF2/WF3 on the executor path (auto-run)

**Status: IN PROGRESS** — 4 children merged (#464 #480 #445 #446), #465 (W2) building, #466–#474 pending. (The roadmap chip aggregates the merged sub-sections below; the epic itself is open until #474 closes it.)

Wire WF2/WF3 to the `phase_executor` engine per the ratified architecture (the real #417).
Doc of record: `docs/planning/2026-07-17-orchestrator-executor-acceptance-criteria.md`.
Queue (topo, D-1 pins + D-2 insertion): #464 (W1) ✓ · #480 ✓ · #445 ✓ · #446 ✓ · **#465 (W2)** ← IN PROGRESS ·
#466 (W3) · #467 (W4) · #468 (W5) · #469 (W6) · #470 (W7) · #447 · #471 (W8) ·
#472 (W9) · #449 (W10) · #473 (W11) · #474 (W12, closes epic). AUTO MODE campaign
(owner grant 2026-07-18, session-scoped); overnight D-3 autonomous posture from ~03:00.

### #464 — capability manifest + WIRED_SEATS full set + attested build-audit path (W1) · v3.52.0

Every routing-table seat carries a required `manifest` (`session_policy` fresh ×7 per D-8,
`tool_grants`, normalized `effort`, per-provider `confinement`, `bounds`), fail-closed at load
(schema draft-2020-12 + semantic passes: confinement↔chain-provider coverage,
`policy.enforced_roles ⊆ ENFORCEABLE_ROLES` evaluator ceiling, name↔role binding lint). Table
grows to 7 seats (+`analysis` sonnet-primary, +`design` = the #428 competitive pair as a static
row whose dispatch stays bake-off-owned; single-dispatch refused). `check_pre` drops the
unconditional build hard-deny for a launch-bound `GateAttestation` (anti-replay
`launch_input_digest`, outcome routing — a `bakeoff` outcome can never authorize single
dispatch; receipts carry `role` + gate evidence; denied-build receipts stay audit-readable);
unrecognized non-empty roles fail closed (#434 part 2, red-before-green on the typo'd-role
cell). `dispatch_seat` gains the gated build path (`--gate-file` + `--plan-context` with EXACT
canonical key-set equality) authenticated via the extracted `complexity_gate.verified_decision`
(+`GateTamperError`, strict empty/missing-key context contract); driver-bench admits build
audits.

- **Design:** r3 — peer consult (gpt) + 3-approach brainstorm + THREE adversarial design passes
  with a dispositions ledger, then a 4th adversarial DIFF pass at Step 11 that caught 2 genuine
  failed-remediations (partial-context acceptance; truthiness-only receipt validation) — fixed
  same-PR. 14-entry terminal-disposition ledger; 2 design loop-backs consumed (budget
  exhausted, pass-3 clean); owner resolved 3 breakers live, Step-11 fixes applied under the
  D-3 overnight posture.
- **Carried forward:** W7 #470 — bake-off audit-spine wiring + orchestrator-minted plan-context
  (issuecomment-5010761468); W2 #465 — runtime manifest resolution per the design-row rule.
- **Session-limit resilience (live):** the 04:20 window hit mid-Step-11 — 3 reviewer agents died
  vacuous and were re-dispatched clean after reset; the codex diff review (separate quota)
  survived and its sidecar was joined on schedule.

### #480 — step-ENTRY state record: machine-readable current position (D-2 insertion) · v3.53.0

Owner-directed mid-campaign insertion. New `hooks/step_state.py` (pure core + thin CLI, stdlib)
writes an observational "now" pointer — `claude_docs/wal/<project>.state.json`, atomic
overwrite-in-place, last-writer-wins — at each numbered step ENTRY of all five workflow skills
(one canonical prose line each, pin-tested). `wal-context` prefers a FRESH record over the
notes-grep, **session-scoped** (a concurrent same-project session's record is suppressed and the
byte-identical grep fallback runs — the raw file stays project-scoped for the owner's statusline,
whose recipe routes through the validating `read` subcommand). Fail-open EVERYWHERE, live-proved
with a crashing-python3 shim; a drift-guard pins that no gating hook references it.

- **Lane run:** small-standard (7-impl estimate; lane-widened to 9 real — version surfaces).
- **Reviews:** 8a on the wal-context commit (converged session-scoping Medium fixed) + lane
  reviewer + adversarial diff (5 Mediums adopted: lazy writer import, reader
  schema/project/freshness-bounds validation, future-timestamp bound, reader-routed statusline
  recipe, collision guard via project-equality).
- **Session-limit resilience:** none needed this child (ran post-reset).

### #445 — per-project phase-seat table in config + single executor resolution · v3.54.0

Foundation child for #446 (setup seed/tweak) and #447 (diagram render): "projects own their
tables" becomes real. New `.rawgentic.json` `phaseExecutorTable {version, file}` descriptor
(complete-replacement pointer, never a merge overlay) → `phase_executor_table` capability
(derive fail-closed incl. control-char/backslash rejection); ONE shared
`executor_routing_lib.resolve_table` serves both consumers — executor CLI (`resolve-seat` gains
`table_source` + `config_digest`) and driver-bench — resolving the declared override (lstat
entry-probe, canonical symlink-safe containment, statically-dead-seat check via public
`target_forbidden_reason`, uniform exit-2 for every declared-override failure) or the new
`phase_executor.routing.default_table_path()` package accessor; `_ROUTING_TABLE_REL` + bench
`TABLE` constants retired. `seed_table` byte-copies the package default (atomic no-clobber
`os.link` publish) for #446.

- **Full spine:** peer consult (gpt, blind) + 3 adversarial design passes (converged pass 3;
  2 design loop-backs consumed — budget exactly spent) + adversarial plan pass + codex diff
  pass; **36-entry disposition ledger** (DF-2 absent-config fail-closed DECLINED citing AC2;
  DF-5 component-swap TOCTOU declined per trust model).
- **Reviews:** 8a on the high-risk resolver commit (2 reviewers, 5 Lows fixed) + 3-agent
  Step 11 (2 Lows fixed incl. exact exit-5 pin) + codex diff (3 adopted, fixed in-branch).
- **Session-limit resilience:** 2nd occurrence — all 3 first-wave Step-11 reviewers died at
  the window (marked `outcome=dead`, re-dispatched clean post-reset); codex diff review
  survived on its separate quota.
- Suite 3428+8skip → 3483+8skip (+55). No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.

### #465 — W2: agentic adapter profiles · PR #486 (green-pending) · v3.56.0

Conditional session persistence (claude resume), codex workspace-write sandbox pinning
(three spike-#452 overrides, fail-closed composition), per-model effort gating with
recorded stepdown. Design converged adversarial pass 3 (volume loop-back pass 1 — 7 High;
all budgets spent; 45-entry ledger). Progress: T1 effort contract + capability registry
committed (bf1a081, suite 3525/8) · T2 LaunchProfile + fail-closed derivation committed
(ca179b4, suite 3540/8; 8a dual review returned — schema-gap Medium fixed in-flight) ·
all 6 tasks + 8a fixes on the 2 high-risk tasks committed; 3-agent Step 11 + codex diff (claude-mutating containment + grants fail-open fixed); **W7 security blocker recorded** — claude mutating dispatch forbidden until a real FS sandbox lands. Suite 3514/8 → 3576/10.

### #446 — seed + tweak phase-seat models through /rawgentic:setup · v3.55.0

Setup Step 2i makes #445's project-owned table usable: `show-table` (human + versioned
`--json` projection; bake-off sets displayed from `bakeoff_policy.BUILD_MODELS`, labeled
informational) + `apply-table` (sparse per-seat patch over the RESOLVED current table,
validated in memory through #445's load path — base + candidate digest guards, canonical
symlink-safe dest containment, atomic no-clobber fresh-create via the factored
`_publish_bytes`, digest-guarded replace re-seed incl. reset-to-default). Accept-defaults =
strict no-op; fresh-create aborts retain-and-warn. Staleness goes source-aware
(`phaseExecutorTable` nudged via switch, three-state fail-open; `reconcile_projects` skips
project-config entries).

- **S1 descope (owner-visible):** AC1's "build bake-off set" parenthetical descoped —
  candidates are a module constant the table cannot carry; follow-up #484 filed + comment
  on #446.
- **Full spine:** peer consult + 3 design passes (2 design loop-backs + 1 spec-tighten w/
  verifier — GLOBAL budget exactly spent) + plan pass + 8a (1 High: symlinked-parent write
  escape, probe-proven + fixed) + 3-agent Step 11 + codex diff (reset TOCTOU guard fixed);
  **40-entry ledger**.
- Suite 3483+8skip → 3514+8skip (+31). No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.

## Epic #422 — per-phase model routing + deterministic execution engine (auto-run)

Route WF2/WF3 model seats from bench-#14 evidence through a deterministic `phase_executor`
engine. Plan: `docs/planning/2026-07-16-per-phase-model-routing.md`. Children (dep order):
#424 (E1 package) ✓ · #425 (E2 enforcement) ✓ · #426 (E3 seat-table config) ✓ ·
**#427 (E4 seat cutover)** ← this slot · then #428 #429 #431 #430 #420 #419 #417.

### #427 — ship/intake/plan seats through the executor (E4) · v3.45.0

The FIRST consumer of `phase_executor`: `hooks/executor_routing_lib.py` — a `resolve-seat` /
`dispatch` CLI routing the **ship / intake / plan** seats through `run_seat` as a verified choke
point, gated by a per-seat `executorRouting` toggle in `.rawgentic_workspace.json` (default
`inherit`; the executor is off until a seat is opted in, so merge is a no-op — the prose call sites
land in #417). `dispatch` wires a per-attempt `check_pre` (primary + every fallback target, selected
by the engine's attempt-index) → `run_seat` → `verify_post` → append-only routing-audit log; a
three-way `inherit`/`executor`/`driver_only` tag (merge/CI/deploy/Step-16 stay driver-inline) and a
granular fail-closed exit taxonomy (2 malformed · 3 availability/quota retryable · 4 enforcement
breach · 5 internal/audit), structured `{ok:false,error}` on every non-zero. Capture/permit dirs
derive under the project repo's git-ignored `.rawgentic/`; `reconcile_run` deferred to #420; the
build seat stays fail-closed until #429. Supersedes #418.

- **Design:** rev 3, hardened over a Codex peer consult + a Step-4 adversarial-on-design pass + a
  verifier round (base=project-repo-root, run_id-less capture, pool-sig permits, per-attempt
  check_pre, absent-vs-malformed config).
- **Review:** Step-8a 2-reviewer (fixed a QuotaTimeout-escape High + exit-taxonomy gaps) + Step-11
  3-agent + Codex adversarial-diff (fail-closed corrupt-workspace, repo-root containment,
  RoutingError/schema-error in the taxonomy; D2 "post-check not appended" rejected — reconcile
  recomputes verify_post).
- **Verification:** full suite 3151+6skip → **3208+7skip** (0 failing); pylint hooks+tests 10/10;
  security scan PASS (iac n/a). A **live** ship-seat `claude --print` spike (RUN_LIVE) verified the
  real `actual_model==sonnet` end-to-end. No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.

### #428 — competitive design rounds + build bake-off + glm judge (E5) · DEFERRED

`ZHIPUAI_API_KEY` absent in the autonomous-run environment → the live glm-5.2 competitive judging
(its acceptance) cannot be verified. Deferred with a blocker comment (no code written); the auto-run
continued at #429. Revisit in a session with the key (`pip install "zhipuai>=2.1.5"` + the key).

### #429 — deterministic complexity gate (E6) · v3.46.0

`hooks/complexity_gate.py` — a pure, fail-closed `needs_bakeoff(task, issue, plan_est, cfg) ->
GateDecision` ("code routes, prose never does"). Bakes off on risk_level==high / complexity==complex
/ security-surface glob hit (auth/secrets/payments/migrations/CI/crypto) / diff-lines-over /
file-count-over; fail-closed on missing/invalid metadata (incl. non-serializable values + unparseable
thresholds — both hardened in the Step-11 review). Returns decision + reason codes + input snapshot +
sha256 policy digest (executor recomputes at admission). Shipped in its OWN module (not plan_lib) —
executor-consumed (#428/#430), not a WF2-prose helper, so out of plan_lib's skill-wired surface (the
`test_skill_helpers` reverse drift-guard caught the initial plan_lib placement). Small-standard lane;
suite 3208+7 → 3246+7 (+38); no spine change → no diagram REV. (child 5/10)

### #431 — multi-account Claude lanes via CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (E8) · v3.47.0

The `phase_executor` claude adapter sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<credential_ref>` per invocation
(`run_subprocess` gains an env-MERGE param; `_claude_env` builds it), so a lane's `credential_ref`
selects an isolated Claude config tree = an independent quota pool (per-config-dir 5-hour window).
Quota-per-account was already wired (engine keys permits by account=credential_ref); per-account
ceilings + parallel lanes fall out for free. No `credential_ref` → environment inherited unchanged;
codex/zhipu untouched. + per-account setup runbook + ToS note in the phase_executor README.
Small-standard lane; suite 3246+7 → 3252+7 (+6); no spine change → no diagram REV. (child 6/10)

### #420 — routing telemetry in run records · v3.48.0

Extends run-record `dispatches[]` with OPTIONAL per-dispatch routing telemetry (preferred/actual
model, fallback_reason, queued_ms, concurrency, selector inputs) — validated-optional (old records +
pre-#420 entries stay rc=0), populated once #417 wires the executor. Small-standard lane; suite

### #419 — model-routing.md provenance + refresh rule · v3.48.1

New `docs/model-routing.md`: the executable refresh-rule decision table (role→phase map, gap test =
median-gap>pooled-sd effect-size heuristic, floor test ≥70 subagent/≥80 driver + driver 5/6 gates,
move-only-when-both-pass, provenance re-stamped every decision incl. "no change") + a drift-guard

Documents three dispatch contracts in the single-sourced `<model-routing-resolve>` block: seat
fallback chains + circuit breaker (chain exhaustion = handled hard failure, never silent downgrade),
≤3-Claude concurrency ceiling (effective 2 driver-active), driver-seat guidance (opus recommended,
not enforced). Shared source edited + synced into implement-feature; fix-bug's bespoke WF3 block
updated directly (no forced unification). Drift-guard pins the canonical fallback sentence. Lane;

## Epic #408 slot 2 — #393: disposition ledger for pass-N adversarial reviews · v3.40.0

**Issue.** #393 (feature, standard, full spine; epic #408 auto-run child 2, scoped
auto-merge grant 2026-07-15): each adversarial engine invocation saw only the
artifact, so multi-pass gates re-derived and RE-LITIGATED settled decisions —
observed on saystory #167, #69, and three times in the #407 run (the same
category-poisoning disposition dissolved at pass 2, pass 3, and the Step-11 diff
review).

**What shipped.** Orchestrator-persisted terminal-disposition memory:
`plan_lib.append_disposition` (fail-closed writer) / `read_dispositions` (tolerant
per-line binary reader — one bad byte costs one line) / `fold_dispositions`
(last-write-wins, last-occurrence order) / `compute_finding_key` (engine
dedupe-tuple sha256, category deliberately excluded — relabel-proof) /
`strip_reopens`. Pass-N dispatches fold `claude_docs/.wf2-state/<issue>/dispositions.jsonl`
to a 0600 temp copy and add `--dispositions <temp> --issue <n>`; the engine
re-validates, renders escaped single lines (C0/C1 + U+2028/U+2029 stripped), caps
at 20KB (most-recent kept, loud truncation), and injects a SECOND independent
nonce fence with a disposition-aware instruction (declined/dissolved: no re-raise
without `REOPENS <id>:` + new evidence; adopted: DO re-raise if still broken).
Split fail policy: benign → fail-OPEN `ledger: degraded`/`ledger: empty`,
`--issue` mismatch → fail-CLOSED exit 6 → `failed (ledger integrity)`. Steps
4/6/11 wire gate-close persistence, the dispatch sequence, and the join backstop
(DECLINED/DISSOLVED match auto-dissolves; ADOPTED match → `possible failed
remediation`). No flag → byte-identical prompt, pinned vs a committed pre-change
golden. Diagram REV 3.40.0 (stations 4+11 delta).

**Decisions (this slot).** Plan-gate: 4 adversarial Highs dissolved-with-evidence
(2 reviewer-scope — the design §1/§5 held the "missing" contracts; 1 intentional
key asymmetry; 1 already-defended realpath containment), 4 Mediums adopted. D-11
task reorder (T1→T4): a cross-surface corpus guard sat red between new public
helpers and their steps.md wiring — both plan reviewers missed the sequencing.
Golden-fixture base64-encoding DECLINED (fence contract held live; auditability
wins). Import layering confirmed coherent (plan_lib owns `.wf2-state`
persistence, engine owns the fence/escaping contract).

**Reviews.** Step-4 gate closed in the prior session (3 passes, 13+7+6 findings,
budget 3/3 exhausted — Steps 8/11 required clean-or-blocker). 8a ×2 on all 3
high-risk tasks: 1 High fixed red-first (text-mode UnicodeDecodeError dropped the
whole ledger on one bad byte) + 5 cheap adopts (honest empty-vs-degraded signal,
loud truncation, Unicode line-separator strip, pre-change golden, empty-string
seam). Step 11 (3 agents + cross-model diff pass): 3H+2M adopted red-first —
including the diff pass LIVE-DOGFOODING `--dispositions` on its own diff (ledger
seeded from the plan-gate's dissolved Highs; codex re-litigated neither) and
catching that the no-re-raise instruction wrongly covered ADOPTED entries.
Security scan clean (iac/sca visible skips). Suite 2920+1skip→2983+1skip, zero
regressions, red-before-green per task.

**Status.** PR + CI + merge SHA filled by the next slot's pass (established
convention). Telemetry for this slot embedded below.

## Epic #408 slot 1 — #407: adversarial findings carry a loopback-class · v3.39.0

**Issue.** #407 (feature, standard, full spine; epic #408 auto-run, scoped auto-merge
grant 2026-07-15): WF2 Step 4's fold treated every WF5 adversarial Critical/High as
`untagged` → full design loop-back by construction. The #403 run burned its entire
3/3 global budget on prose tightening; the spec_tighten cheap path was unreachable
from adversarial findings.

**What shipped.** `FINDINGS_SCHEMA` gains a required-but-nullable `loopback_class`
(plain `["string","null"]`, NO enum — a null-member enum has no strict-mode precedent;
the prompt constrains vocab). The review prompt carries the WF2 rubric (spec-tightening
= intent right/text wrong, stateable verbatim; design-flaw incl. the boundary clarifier;
unsure→design-flaw; null for Medium/Low) + an injection-guard extension naming
loop-back-classification steering. `validate_finding` is FULLY permissive on the field
(whole-report gate :1220/:1465 — a bad advisory tag must never parse_error a review);
the new pure `loopback_class_entries` owns the fail-close: security-category
Critical/High → `untagged` UNCONDITIONALLY (case-insensitive, self-contained),
exact-case vocab after strip, else `untagged` (backward compatible). WF2 item-7
consumes the tag (security override stated first), the cheap-path verifier brief is
sidecar-sourced with per-originating-finding confirmation, and the Step-4 dispatch now
explicitly wires `--findings-json` (Step-11 catch: the field is sidecar-only —
without it the feature is silently inert at its target step). Diagram REV 3.39.0
(station 4 delta).

**Decisions (this slot).** Enum dropped at gate pass 1 (unproven strict-mode shape,
zero correctness cost — helper constrains). Vocab-rejecting/type-checking validator
DECLINED twice (peer + pass-2): normalize drops invalid findings + whole-report gate.
Category-distrust DECLINED ×3 (would nullify the cheap path; residual risk documented;
the recurring re-litigation across passes is live evidence for #393's disposition
ledger). Case asymmetry: security override case-INSENSITIVE (widening fail-closed net),
vocab match case-SENSITIVE (repair conceals drift).

**Reviews.** 3 design-gate passes (17 unique findings, all terminal): 2 design
loop-backs + the run's FIRST spec_tighten cheap pass — both reviewers repeatedly
demonstrated the pre-#407 cost live (every adversarial Critical/High entered untagged;
2/3 budget burned on the run shipping the fix). Plan gate: 5 findings (task-order fix:
version-bump-before-diagram-REV — linkage test is one-directional). 8a ×2 on the
high-risk tasks (1 Low applied: self-contained override). Step 11: 3 agents +
adversarial diff (5 unique: station-13 stray marker, the sidecar-wiring gap;
2 re-litigations dissolved). Security scan clean (iac/sca visible skips). Suite
2889+1skip→2920+1skip, zero regressions, red-before-green per task.

**Status.** *(backfilled by slot 2's pass)* PR #409, CI hard lanes green,
squash-merged `7bea79f` 2026-07-15, issue #407 auto-closed, v3.39.0 on main.

## Standalone — #403: selectable GLM review/consult backend (gpt | glm | both) · v3.38.0

**Issue.** #403 (feature, standard, full spine — new optional dependency): WF5
adversarial-review and WF13 peer-consult were hardwired to the Codex CLI; the owner's
GLM Coding Plan subscription (proven live in rawgentic-next's bench-judge lane) makes
a second, independent cross-model backend available.

**What shipped.** A `backend` field (`gpt`|`glm`|`both`, absent → gpt) on the
`adversarialReview`/`peerConsult` config blocks + `--backend` on the `review`/`consult`/
`prereq` CLI and both skills. New GLM engine path in `hooks/adversarial_review_lib.py`:
zhipuai SDK (deferred import, version floor 2.1.5), sync-STREAMING with a two-layer
timeout (SDK read timeout at client construction + per-chunk deadline), schema-in-prompt
+ the existing tolerant validators, the same nonce-fenced injection defense, unbypassable
in-run-function secret scan (supplied `artifact_text` is scanned too). `both` runs each
backend independently — gpt keeps every path byte-identical, glm writes `-glm` siblings
(report suffix AFTER the date; sidecar/out siblings), exit 5 = machine-distinguishable
PARTIAL. Fail-closed egress control: a present-but-invalid backend value (incl. explicit
JSON null, half/empty resolution args) REFUSES with exit 2 before any provider call —
never silently laundered into gpt. Embedded WF2 Step 3/11 call sites resolve the config
backend via the new `backend` subcommand and consume exit 5 + dual sidecars with a
deterministic merge.

**Verification.** TDD throughout (130 new tests, injected fake clients — CI network-free);
**LIVE pre-merge smoke on the z.ai Coding Plan subscription endpoint**: glm-only review
(exit 0, GLM reviewer line, findings parsed) and both-mode with dual sidecars (exit 0,
stdout manifest, gpt sidecar untagged/byte-compat, glm sibling tagged). Suite
2759+1skip→2889+1skip.

**Gates.** Step 4 ran FOUR passes (owner elected a 4th over escalation; 36 deduped
findings adjudicated, budget 3/3 spent — the cross-model reviewer re-litigated the
owner's decided live-smoke fork repeatedly; discard-with-reason each time). 8a dual
reviews on all 4 high-risk tasks (16 findings; fixes incl. a lazy-urlsplit port crash
on the consent path). Step 11: all four review sources converged on one High (prereq
CLI missing `--backend`) — fixed red-before-green with three more diff-review catches
(JSON-null backend, empty resolution args, consult out-sibling/artifact collision).



### #375 — FTS5 session index + `/rawgentic:session-recall` skill · v3.33.0

**Issue.** #375 (feature, epic #378 child 1/3): full-text search over session history was
the one capability the 2026-07-10 nine-tool comparison found genuinely missing —
mempalace is curated semantic memory; nothing searched the raw 2.35 GB JSONL corpus.

**What shipped.** `hooks/session_index.py` (pure core + thin CLI): incremental `index`
over `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (recursive — the corpus nests `subagents/` trees;
per-file `(mtime_ns, size)` high-water marks, per-file transactions, stat-recheck for
live-appending files), provenance-carrying `search` (FTS5 external-content table + sync
triggers, bm25 deterministic ordering, `--literal` phrase quoting, inclusive date
filters), `status` (versions, malformed/ignored/rejected split, staleness). Single-writer
`fcntl.flock`; WAL concurrent readers; `--rebuild` builds a temp DB and atomically
`os.replace()`s it in. Guards: missing-corpus-dir refusal, partial-vanish ratio refusal
(>50%), startup schema/parser gate, reader staleness warning, lone-surrogate sanitize,
dir 0700/files 0600, symlink refusal (DB + lock). New workspace-management skill
`session-recall` wraps it; registration across all surfaces (17 skills, workspace 6→7).

**Gate story.** Step 4 ran two passes (design loop-back + user-chosen spec-tighten cheap
path, D1): 23 unique findings, all terminal. Step 11's adversarial diff review caught a
Critical the spike had masked — `executescript()` autocommits, so the in-place
"one-transaction" rebuild was never atomic; the peer consult's temp-DB swap (initially
rejected as over-complex) was reinstated. Live Task-4 execution against the real corpus
caught two more the synthetic fixtures missed: `*/*.jsonl` missed 3,308 nested files, and
77% of message lines are legitimately textless (tool_use/tool_result/thinking) — the
format-drift guard now measures true shape failures (rebuilt live: 5,139 files, 76,769
messages, 0 rejected). Risk-tagging hit the `decompose` band because the bare `session`
path pattern matches every file of a session-tooling feature (D2: manual tags kept,
word-scope follow-up filed). Suite 2614+1skip→2670+1skip. No diagram REV (leaf skill +
hook only). PR #386 squash-merged `5675cc1`, CI 4/4 green, issue auto-closed.

### #376 — WF17 `/rawgentic:session-mining` — detect→queue→synthesize→gate · v3.34.0

**Issue.** #376 (feature, epic #378 child 2/3): adopt claude-reflect's verified shape
(detect → durable queue → synthesis → human gate) built native, report-only, no LLM in
detect.

**What shipped.** `hooks/session_mining_lib.py`: deterministic detectors over the #375
index (`--literal` phrase queries; friction + restated-error proxies) and session notes
(command mentions with same-section UUID session-id resolution; unresolvable =
evidence-only). Append-only event-log queue with sha256 candidate identity,
human-over-machine reducer (unknown/machine events can never override a decline),
tail-parse torn-tail guard (repairs valid-but-unterminated hand-fixed lines; truncates
only unparseable fragments; non-object tails truncate too), mid-file corruption fails
propose/disposition closed, best-effort redaction preserving paths/UUIDs, verbatim
quotes via read-only #375-DB JOIN (fail-loud; fallback marked `index-snippet`).
Recurrence ≥ 3 DISTINCT sessions, bucketed per (detector, pattern) — the cross-detector
leak was caught because the live run mined its own session's notes. WF17 skill mirrors
WF14's report-only pattern; WF1 handoff is a re-draftable template prompt.

**Gate story.** Step 4 took THREE passes + a verifier-guided micro-fix, consuming the
entire loop-back budget (design ×2 + spec_tighten ×1, D7–D10 in the run log): the peer
consult refuted my hybrid detector (sampling bias — option C with proxy labeling won,
D6), the adversarial reviews forced the accepted-event lifecycle, absorbing-terminal
semantics, and the torn-tail guard — whose first version the incremental verifier then
proved converted the benign case into fatal corruption (fix reversed to
truncate-then-append). Step 11's adversarial diff found the recurrence cross-detector
leak + accepted-evidence loss; one High rejected with rationale (torn-tail-as-declined —
write-time visibility). Live verification against the real corpus (temp queue): 1,031
signals → 177 patterns → 10 proposals with verbatim evidence, AC4 decline-then-re-propose
verified live. Suite 2670+1skip→2723+1skip. WF17 skeletal diagram entry, no WF2-spine
REV. PR #387 squash-merged `ccebaf4`, CI 4/4 green, issue auto-closed.

### #377 — WF14 rubric v2: cross-session recurrence evidence wiring · v3.35.0

**Issue.** #377 (feature, epic #378 child 3/3, complexity S): wire #375/#376's
recurrence evidence into WF14 run-feedback — prose-only, no hook code.

**What shipped.** Small-standard LANE run (the epic's first; D11). WF14 Step 2 friction
findings gain an OPTIONAL `recurrence: <n> runs (index query, quoted)` tag (#375 index
query, distinct sessions, --limit raised past the bm25 default); rubric stamped v2 with
a comparability note (no anchors moved — recurrence raises CONFIDENCE only); provenance
boundary pinned (index SUPPLEMENTS; Step 1 marker-grep stays SOLE run-fact source; Step
1 prose byte-identical); Step 4 cap-sharing (WF17 candidates at ≥ 3 runs share the
3-issue pool; below threshold never crowd out a defect). 4 new drift-guard pins + the
v1 stamp pin updated. Lane gates: single-reviewer Step 11 PASS (2 Low prose nits fixed:
a splice-duplicated clause, a --limit undercount note); adversarial diff mechanically
skipped (no security surface); 0 loop-backs. Suite 2723+1skip→2727+1skip. No diagram
REV (skeletal wf14 sheet, prose-only). PR #388 squash-merged `637f66c`, CI 4/4 green, issue auto-closed. Epic #378: all 3 children shipped (v3.33.0–v3.35.0).

## Epic #333 — subagent-dispatch observability + review-gate hardening (auto-run)

### #329 — structured dispatches[] in the run-record schema + aggregate rollup · v3.26.0

**Issue.** #329 (feature, epic #333 child 1/10): the #328 dispatch audit needed ~2.3 GB
of transcript archaeology to answer "did subagents run?" — `run_records.jsonl` had no
structured dispatch field.

**What shipped.** Optional, present-is-strict `dispatches[]` in the run-record schema
(`hooks/work_summary.py` validate_record — the usage #155 / goal_guard #156 precedent):
per-entry `role`/`subagent_type`/`model`/`effort` + orthogonal `outcome`
(ok/error/retried/dead; dead = vacuous return) vs `resolution` (primary/fallback/generic).
Aggregate rollup: counts by role/model (null model → `"(none)"`), dead rate, fallback
rate, `runs_with_dispatches`; the section is omitted ENTIRELY when no record carries the
field (single contract, per-partition under `--group-by`). Documented in
`docs/run-records.md`. Emission wired by follow-up #330.

**Reviews.** Step 4 quality-bar (opus): 2 Low ambiguous, both resolved in-gate from repo
conventions ("(none)" sentinel; per-partition omit). Step 8a on the high-risk validation
task: 2 reviewers, clean. Step 11: 2 opus reviewers NO FINDINGS + codex adversarial diff
2 Medium @0.7 — dropped by the severity band and refuted against code. Security scan:
0 blocking / 0 advisory (iac n/a, sca nothing-to-scan). Lane: small-standard (3 impl
files). Suite 2435+1skip → 2503+1skip (+68). No spine change → no diagram REV.

**PR.** #347 — merged 839f5a2, all 4 CI checks green (test, lint, code-review, security-review).

### #330 — emit dispatches[] from the workflow completion steps · v3.27.0

**Issue.** #330 (feature, epic #333 child 2/10, depends on #329): the schema existed but
nothing wrote it — the audit line prescribed by the dispatch prescriptions carried no
subagent_type/outcome/resolution and never reached the run-record.

**What shipped.** Canonical completion-time audit line `DISPATCH issue=<n> role=… type=…
model=… effort=… outcome=… resolution=…` in the dispatch prescriptions (shared block →
synced WF2 SKILL.md; bespoke review-only WF3 variant), with per-invocation / flush-left /
retry / pre-suspend emission rules and a resolution decision table (`fallback` =
carried-never-emitted). Assembly at WF2 Step 16 item 2d / WF3 Step 14 item 3b: grep
`^DISPATCH issue=<n>` from session notes, null→JSON null, never dedup, malformed lines
counted (incl. indented rescues), zero→omit; under-count detection owned by WF14.
Capture contract + worked example in `docs/run-records.md ### Capture (#330)`. 9 drift
guards incl. regex byte-identity.

**Reviews.** Step 4 took the FULL loop-back budget (3/3): 2 design loop-backs (run-header
scoping anchor matched nothing in the real notes corpus → issue-scoped lines; resolution
ladder unmapped → decision table) + 1 spec-tighten (stale cross-references), final
verifier CLEAN. Step 6 adversarial-on-plan: 2 Medium plan clarifications. 8a: 5 prose
hardenings applied. Step 11 (re-dispatched after a session-limit kill — 3 dead agents +
1 dead memorize recorded as outcome=dead DISPATCH lines): 1 Medium changelog inversion
fixed + 3 Low hardenings + adversarial 1 applied / 2 refuted. Scan 0/0. DOGFOOD: this
run's own record carries 19 assembled dispatches[] entries (4 dead from the limit kill).
Suite 2503+1skip → 2512+1skip. No spine change → no diagram REV.

**PR.** #349 — merged 4a629df, all 4 CI checks green.

### #331 — WF3 Step 9 per-slot fallback chain + dead-return detection · v3.27.1

**Issue.** #331 (fix, epic #333 child 3/10): WF3's NON-NEGOTIABLE Step 9 gate named only
two external-plugin agents with no declared fallback and no vacuous-return handling — a
mandatory gate with an undeclared single point of failure.

**What shipped.** Declared per-slot three-tier chain (pr-review-toolkit named →
rawgentic-reviewer substitute → generic inline; never collapses two reviews to one;
both-slots-tier-2 distinct briefs) + dead-return detection (vacuous = DEAD, relaunch
once, second death → REVIEW_DISPATCH_FAILED + ERROR protocol; mid-tier runtime error
retries once then descends) + two named failure modes + headless Step 9 ERROR entry.
WF3 resolution table reconciled (tier1=primary, tier2=fallback — the first real
producer, tier3=generic; the pre-existing #330 table mismatch fixed). Descent emission
split by trigger (resolve-failure emits no line for a tier that never ran — no
fabricated audit records; runtime-error descent carries the abandoned tier's own
resolution). WF2's 8a + Step 11 reviewer sites gained the same dead-return rule —
this session's own limit-kill (3 dead reviewers) is the live case. WF3 diagram
REV 3.27.1, full-page snapshots re-verified 1440×2586 both themes. Suite
2512+1skip → 2518+1skip. Reviews caught real: pass-1 design collided with the
#330 tables merged 30 minutes earlier; Step 11 caught the fabricated-audit-line
semantics. Loop-backs 1/3.

**PR.** #351 — merged 70e7d75, all 4 CI checks green.

### #341 — issue-keyed step markers · v3.28.0

**Issue.** #341 (feature, epic #333 child 4/10, WF14 dogfood finding): step markers
carried no issue key — concurrent runs sharing one notes file were mechanically
un-attributable (reproduced THREE times across this epic's own runs).

**What shipped.** Per-marker-type canonical key-slot contract (5 classes + the
hook-emitted promotion shape) with an AUTHORITATIVE slot table, emitter caution, and
declared deferrals in both `<step-tracking>` blocks; 14 keyed prescribed literals
(incl. the Step 4-discard and Step 6 adversarial siblings the 8a review caught);
`format_promotion_note` gains a backward-compatible `issue` kwarg (TDD, `#`-input
normalized); run-scoped consumer rules at all three read sites (WF2 MARKERS_COMPLETE,
WF3 §Workflow Resumption, WF14 attribution with inlined slots — cache blocks
cross-skill reads); legacy fallback tightened to pre-#341/stale-cache only;
`docs/session-notes.md` updated. Lane-widened honestly noted (9 impl files > 7 after
8a hardening). Suite 2518+1skip → 2534+1skip. Reviews caught real: unpinned slot
table, stale canonical doc, wrong changelog file refs, fail-open fallback framing.
Loop-backs 2/3. No spine change → no diagram REV.

### #340 — multi-pass gate counting rule + merged-gate reviewer_kind precedence · v3.29.0

**Issue.** #340 (feature, epic #333 child 5/10, WF14 dogfood finding F-1): the run-record
schema gave multi-pass gates no counting rule (the #337 record shipped an eyeballed 14/14
matching no defensible derivation) and single-slot `reviewer_kind` could not describe a
merged self-review+codex gate.

**What shipped.** Two documented-and-guarded semantics rules: (1) `findings` = UNIQUE
findings across all passes (identity = same artifact location AND same required change),
`resolved` = terminal FINAL disposition at gate close (applied / fixed-in-gate /
refuted-with-cited-evidence / dropped-by-band; band-drops count in both), computed at
gate close and persisted — assembly reads, never re-derives; (2) merged-gate
`reviewer_kind` records the gate-DEFINING mechanism (Step 4/6 → `inline`, Step 11 →
`hand_rolled_multi`; `→ codex` scoped to sole-mechanism gates; skipped gate omits the
key). Canonical prose + worked example in `run-record.md`; WF3 §14 pointer;
`docs/run-records.md` subsection; WF14 rubric weak-spot checks audit against both rules
(pre-#340 records = `known-limitation`). No validator change — shape untouched.

**Reviews.** Step 8a (T1 high): 2 opus reviewers — R2 High @0.8 real (rule landed where
per-finding input no longer exists → compute-at-gate-close persistence added). Step 11:
R1 1 Med confirmed (changelog test count), R2 clean; codex adversarial 3 — A1 High
(disposition-alias escape clause reopened the closed set → closed), A2 Med (pre-#340
reviewer_kind legacy carve-out → added), A3 Low = issue #343's exact subject (tracked,
not fixed here). Security scan 0/0 (iac n/a, sca nothing-to-scan). Lane: small-standard
(5 impl files ≤ 7). 6 new drift guards. Suite 2534+1skip → 2540+1skip. Loop-backs 1/3.

### #338 — runFeedback embedded invocation wired into WF2/WF3 completion · v3.30.0

**Issue.** #338 (feature, epic #333 child 6/10, follow-up to #337): the WF14
run-feedback skill shipped embed-ready but deliberately unwired — every assessment this
epic ran was a manual invocation.

**What shipped.** Opt-in embedded self-assessment item in WF2 Step 16 (item 5) and WF3
Step 14 (item 6): gate on `adversarial_review_lib.py is-enabled --key runFeedback`
(generic key parser, live-probed, no code change), silent skip on absent/disabled (the
peerConsult pattern), enabled → invoke the `/rawgentic:run-feedback` core path with
explicit `--record /tmp/wf{2,3}-run-record.json --wf <n> --session-notes <notes-path>`.
Fail-open (AC3): assessment failure logs + continues; runs regardless of summarize rc
(degraded mode covers schema-invalid records); report-only for the plugin source +
PR-terminal-safe → runs in headless, where WF14's outward writes (report pair, ≤3
filed issues, mempalace memory) proceed autonomously. Stale not-wired prose retired in run-feedback SKILL.md +
config-reference.md.

**Reviews.** (filled at Step 11) Lane: small-standard. 4 new drift guards. Suite

### #343 — markdown-table rendering + human-first at-a-glance report structure · v3.31.0

**Issue.** #343 (feature, epic #333 child 7/10, owner request from the first WF14
dogfood + A3 in #340's Step 11): `_render_body_plain` had no markdown-table branch —
every table row in a `--style plain` artifact (WF14 reports, WF5 reviews, design docs)
rendered as a literal `<p>| ... |</p>` paragraph; and the WF14 report template never
mandated a human-first structure.

**What shipped.** GFM table branch in `hooks/render_artifact.py` (header +
`| --- | :-: |` separator detection, contiguous pipe rows, escape-first per-cell via
`_inline(html.escape(...))`, `close_list()` before emission; pipe row with no
separator stays a paragraph; fenced tables stay code; existing table CSS reused —
roadmap cards get tables for free). WF14 report structure made explicitly human-first:
rubric.md gains "Report structure — human-first" (canonical sentence, drift-guarded)
mandating the `## At a glance` opener (bolded verdict, six dimension scores with
one-line verdicts, best catch, worst friction, routed line) before evidence detail;
SKILL.md Step 3 points there. Real-thing check: rendering the committed #338 WF14
report produced 3 `<table>`, 0 raw pipe paragraphs.

**Reviews.** (filled at Step 11) Lane: small-standard. 9 renderer tests (red 5-failed
evidence) + 3 drift guards. Suite 2544+1skip → 2556+1skip.

**PR.** *(backfilled by #344's pass)* PR #367 squash-merged `912a629`, all 4 CI checks
green.

### #344 — visual design language + per-artifact-type templates · v3.32.0

**Issue.** #344 (feature, epic #333 child 8/10, depends on #343): six artifact surfaces
funnel through a renderer with two styles and a minimal markdown subset — artifacts
looked inconsistent and each skill invented its own document structure.

**What shipped.** Seven-template registry in `hooks/render_artifact.py` (plain, roadmap,
report, design, dashboard, review, spec): one shared escape-first block renderer,
per-template CSS layers over a component stylesheet (score chips, severity badges,
RFC-2119 requirement badges — light+dark), `tpl-<name>` body classes, narrow
inline-stage decorators (code-span-skipping, hard-break-bridging). Paragraphs gained
standard soft-wrap semantics (multi-line bold fixed, two-space hard breaks, CR
normalization). `design_artifact_style`: full vocabulary, absent→design, invalid→plain
+warning, never-raises hardened. `docs/design-language.md` + byte-reproducible exemplar;
five in-repo surfaces name their template with drift-guarded canonical sentences
(WF3's missing style resolution fixed — the WF2/WF3 asymmetry). Workspace
design-doc-publish updated in place (stated gap: outside the repo, no CI guard).

**Reviews.** Full spine. Step 4: 2 adversarial passes (9 High/Medium pass 1 → design
loop-back consumed → 7 Medium pass 2, dispositioned). Step 6 adversarial-on-plan:
6 Medium dispositioned. 8a on both high-risk tasks: 3 Low applied (CRLF, MUST-NOT
bridge, unknown-style warning). Step 11 (3 agents + adversarial diff): 4 fixed incl.
a confirmed never-raises violation (non-list `projects` TypeError), 1 refuted
(CSP-inline claim vs the established no-external-hosts contract). Loop-backs 1/3.
Suite 2556+1skip → 2611+1skip.

**PR.** *(backfilled by #342's pass)* PR #368 squash-merged `7bb8928`, all 4 CI checks
green.

### #332 — Step 8 inline-vs-delegated expectation documented · v3.32.1

**Issue.** #332 (docs, epic #333 child 9/10, #328 audit follow-up): the skill text
implied delegation was obligatory whenever `implementation` resolved non-`inherit`,
while the audit measured 6/6 genuine runs inline — doc/behavior misalignment.

**What shipped.** One Step 8 paragraph: when the resolved implementation model equals
the session/orchestrator model, inline is an expected, acceptable outcome (delegation =
isolation/parallelism, not obligation), citing the audit, honesty-bounded (the sonnet
falsification experiment stays open). 2 drift guards. Reviewer verified every claim
against the audit primary source. Lane small-standard; loop-backs 0/3. Suite
2611+1skip → 2613+1skip. *(Slot added by #342's pass — a convention bend owned in
#332's WF14 report: the slot should have ridden PR #369.)*

**PR.** #369 — merged `f8434bf`, all 4 CI checks green.

### #342 — doc-rot batch · v3.32.2

**Issue.** #342 (fix, epic #333 child 10/10, WF14 dogfood F-3): three stale/un-guarded
doc surfaces batched so none is lost silently.

**What shipped.** CLAUDE.md pointer `:1348`→`:1306`; `load_adversarial_review_config`
docstring gains the live `runFeedback` key (the issue's cited `is_enabled_for` was
already fixed by #338 — honest citation delta recorded); Codex manifest
`longDescription` count corrected 20→16 AND converted to a computed disk-glob guard
(#271 pattern, red at 20≠16). Workspace `add-skill` stale hand-pinned count replaced
with read-from-test guidance in place. Lane small-standard; loop-backs 0/3. Suite
2613+1skip → 2614+1skip.

**PR.** #373 — merged `e4d6aa2`, all 4 CI checks green. Epic #333 auto-run complete: 10/10 children shipped, 4 WF14 checkpoints run, aggregate review `docs/reviews/2026-07-10-epic333-wf14-aggregate.{md,html}`.

## Standalone — codex reliability (audit #328 fallout)

### #334 — codex thought-partner dispatches hang: routing rule + dead-job protocol + userns runbook · v3.24.26

**Issue.** #334 (bug): two same-day cross-model "thought partner" dispatches via the
third-party `codex:codex-rescue` path failed — Codex's bwrap sandbox died on Ubuntu
24.04's `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` (kernel-audit evidence on the
issue), then the connector fallback hung >21 min with no watchdog anywhere
(`codex-companion.mjs` has only a 240s status-poll wait).

**RCA pivot.** The issue as filed proposed building a timeout-enforced consult path —
Step 2 found it **already exists** (WF13 `peer-consult` + the `consult` CLI, 600s
fail-closed, 12 lib tests). Root cause reclassified: a routing/guidance gap, not
missing code. Scope-correction comment posted on the issue.

**What shipped.** `docs/codex-reliability.md` — canonical routing rule (load-bearing
consults go through WF13/`consult`, never bare `codex-rescue`), dead-job protocol
(absolute wall-clock ceiling + output-silence signal, mirrors #331's dead-agent
rule), field-tested AppArmor bwrap-userns host runbook (applied + verified on the
dev host same day). Repo-manual §8 pointer so sessions load the rule.
`tests/test_codex_reliability_doc.py` — 5 guards, red before the doc existed.

**Reviews.** Step 4 reflect + cross-model adversarial (codex, `plan` type): 0C/2H/3M,
all 5 applied (dispatch-surface pointer, platform_apis declaration, version/test
naming, 3-piece drift guard, per-slot detail). Step 9: `silent-failure-hunter` +
`code-reviewer` (both Opus): 0C/0H/0M/4L, all 4 applied (absolute-deadline semantics,
recipe-token guard, RCA artifacts committed, sandbox parenthetical softened).
Security scan PASS (iac/sca visible skips).

convention). Telemetry embedded below.

## Epic #309 — harness safety, memory consolidation & workspace janitor

The 2026-07-07 unified-review scope that was never filed (children #300–#308,
mostly supervised live-config items). Repo children run WF2/WF3 under the owner's
2026-07-08 scoped unsupervised grant; live-config children apply with timestamped
backups and close on-issue.

### #320 — port the #314 mechanical-projection read discipline to WF3 · v3.24.23 <br>*(status backfill: PR #321 squash-merged `4e6a723`)*

**Issue.** #320 (epic #309): PR #319 (#314, option 3) shipped fail-closed
**projection** read discipline in WF2 — token-heavy runner/scan/CI output consumed
as a bounded reduction, never a full-log dump into the orchestrator's context — but
`skills/fix-bug/` had zero #314 wiring while WF3 has the same heavy read points
(reproduce-first TDD runs, the full-suite gate, CI `--log-failed`). A prose + drift-
guard port; no hook changes (the `plan_lib` byte-threshold constants are skill-
agnostic and already shipped in #319). WF3 has no security-scan step, so the WF2
Step-11.5 projection has no WF3 equivalent (out of scope).

**What shipped.** `skills/fix-bug/references/steps.md`: Step 7 (RED reproduction run
+ full-suite regression) and Step 8 item 4 now consume test runs as **projections** —
the runner's final-summary tail (pass/fail counts + failing test ids + first assertion
lines), the exit code as the verdict, and targeted reads of the named failing tests
for diagnosis — with the fail-closed rule that an empty/malformed/command-failed
projection on a failing run falls back to the inline raw read (logged). Step 11 item 3
consumes `gh run view --log-failed` as a bounded grep (failing job/step +
assertion/traceback first lines) when over `WF2_READ_DELEGATE_BYTES_LOG`, measured
with a piped `wc -c`, same fail-closed fallback. `tests/test_wf3_clarity.py` gains
`TestDelegatedReadsWF3` — 5 section-sliced, one-canonical-sentence-per-guard drift
guards (repo mistake #6). Option-3 scope held: no LLM reader surface (no
`validate_index`, no `.rawgentic-read-` in WF3); the Step 9 diff read stays inline.

**Path.** Small-standard lane (simple_change, 3 impl files) — collapsed design note +
quality-bar rubric + checklist plan + evidence-only drift; Step 6 skipped; TDD +
2-reviewer code review + security scan retained.

**Reviews.** Two `rawgentic-reviewer` agents (Opus) over the diff: both CLEAN on
correctness/prose/scope; one shared Low (the Step 8 guard was a bare-word `projection`
check, blind to its own drift target) — fixed in-run by pinning the item-4 canonical
sentence. Adversarial diff review enabled but skipped (`no security surface` — 0
high-risk paths/tasks). Security scan clean (0 findings; iac/sca skipped, no lockfile).

**Decisions (this slot).** No workflow-spine change (read-discipline within existing
WF3 Steps 7/8/11, no station/gate/loop-back delta) → **no diagram REV**.

**Status.** PR + CI + merge SHA filled by the next slot's pass (established
convention). Telemetry for this slot is embedded below.

### #303 — WAL recovery report expires stale INTENTs · v3.24.20

**Issue.** #303 (epic #309, review 2a): the SessionStart recovery notice
re-announced every incomplete INTENT forever (~20/session, oldest March 2026,
188 total live) — permanent noise desensitizing against real fresh crash INTENTs.

**What shipped.** `hooks/session-start` announce filter hides incomplete INTENTs
older than `WAL_RECOVERY_MAX_AGE_DAYS` (default 7, clamped [1,365]) behind a
visible suppressed-count line; hidden entries stay on disk (rotation already
preserves incomplete entries regardless of age). Fail-open everywhere: undated
entries, a failed date computation, a filter jq error, and a malformed env value
all announce MORE, never less — with the malformed value noted visibly in the
session context (the hook's stderr is discarded at its callsite). Version
3.24.20 ×3 surfaces. No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane. Step 8a (2 opus reviewers over the hook commit):
1 Medium applied — the filter's jq-error path failed CLOSED against its own
fail-open contract; now exit-code gated. Step 11 (1 opus reviewer + cross-model
Codex diff review, report committed at
`docs/reviews/rawgentic-diff-review-303-e466f037-patch-2026-07-08.md`): both
reviewers independently converged on the dead-stderr-warning finding (fixed +
red-first assert); Codex's all-suppressed-framing Medium refuted with grep
evidence (no programmatic consumer). Security scan PASS (visible skips: iac
not-applicable, sca nothing-to-scan). 8 boundary tests red-before-green.
Suite 2345+1skip → 2353+1skip, 0 failing.

**Status.** PR + CI + merge SHA filled by the next slot's pass (established

## Epic #280 — unified-review EPIC 6 close-out

The 2026-07-08 backlog run shipped children 6b/6c/6d′ (PRs #281–#298, report:
`docs/reviews/2026-07-08-unified-review-backlog-run-report.md`); child 6a (#274)
was owner-gated on a wire-or-delete decision and closes the epic.

### #274 — wire-or-delete external_ref_lib → DELETE · v3.24.18

**Issue.** #274 (epic #280, review 6a): `hooks/external_ref_lib.py` was complete,
tested (16 tests), and documented — with zero production consumers. The intended
consumer (#196/#162 post-PR `/code-review` gate) shipped as a GitHub Action that
never called it.

**Decision.** Owner directed a Codex consult first, then follow it. Codex
recommended **DELETE** (fresh thread; verdict recorded on the issue): wiring now
would create behavior just to justify existing code, reopening an abandoned gate
design with no scheduled owner. First consult attempt is its own lesson — the task
went web-spelunking and its process died leaving a zombie "running" job (23 min);
the scoped no-research retry answered in ~1 minute (memorized).

**What shipped.** Removed `hooks/external_ref_lib.py`,
`tests/hooks/test_external_ref_lib.py`, `docs/external-references.md`; dropped the
two structural parametrization references in `tests/hooks/test_atomic_write_lib.py`.
Historical changelog/campaign/review references stay (append-only history). Version
3.24.18 ×3 surfaces. No workflow-spine change → no diagram REV.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane. Step 11 (1 opus reviewer, all 3 lenses): CLEAN,
0 findings; suite-delta arithmetic independently confirmed (16+2+1=19). Adversarial
diff review: skipped (no security surface). Security scan PASS (visible skips: iac
not-applicable, sca nothing-to-scan). Suite 2359+1skip → 2340+1skip, 0 failing.

### #310 — wal-guard deny() fails closed on huge commands · v3.24.19

**Issue.** #310 (found by #267 R2): deny() passed the full blocked command as one
jq exec argument; over Linux `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` (~128KiB) the exec failed (E2BIG,
rc 126) — empty stdout = ALLOW. The deliberately fail-closed guard failed open.

**What shipped.** Command bounded at deny() entry (`${cmd:0:2000}` + visible
`[truncated: total N chars]`, pure parameter expansion — a first-cut `printf|head`
pipe died of SIGPIPE under pipefail and failed open again, caught red-first).
Review hardening applied: printf-builtin fallback deny on the decision call (ANY
serializer failure previously = allow) + guarded audit `ts=` assignment.

**Reviews.** WF3: 2-reviewer Step 9 (opus — silent-failure hunter + standards;
standards CLEAN, hunter's `ts=` finding applied) + cross-model adversarial on the
RCA (report: `docs/reviews/rawgentic-rca-310-md-2026-07-08.md`; High applied).
5 tests red-before-green. Suite 2340+1skip → 2345+1skip, 0 failing. PR #311.

## Epic #188 fast-follow (post-M4)

WF2 hardening + epic-native workflows + OAuth Action reviews. #189 already shipped
(folded in as slot 12). Ordered slots #190 → #191 → #192 → #193 → #194 → #195
→ #196 → #197 (+ owner-added #205) — **all shipped**; epic #188 closes with #197.
Follow-up #206 (memory migration) remains conditional, outside the ordered list.

### #190 — retire WF2 Step 4 3-judge reflexion panel → reflect-only · v3.2.0

**Issue.** #190 (epic #188 P2): the full-spine Step 4 still ran the same-model
3-judge `/reflexion:critique` panel; owner telemetry measured ≈ 0 gain and the lean
spine shipped 10/10 with 0 loop-backs. Severed AC1 of the abandoned #162.

**What shipped.** WF2 Step 4 runs `/reflexion:reflect` for all lanes; the panel is
removed. Full spine keeps its opt-in cross-model adversarial-on-design sub-step
(WF5, AC2) — high-stakes scrutiny lives there now. Ambiguity breaker, volume
thresholds, and the `design` loop-back budget retained (sourced from reflect, or
merged reflect+adversarial); `critiqueMethod` preamble removed from WF2 (`setup`
keeps it). Fast-path table + SKILL spine one-liner + run-record reviewer_kind
mapping + config-reference + README (feature tables + changelog) all updated.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane. 2 red-first §4 drift guards (no panel / table
both-reflect) + a README regression guard. Step 11 (1 opus, both lenses): logic
NO FINDINGS (item-numbering resolves, breaker-runs-once holds across all 4 rows);
1 Medium leftover — README feature tables still listed WF2 under
`/reflexion:critique` (the #161-class miss) — FIXED + guarded. Security scan clean.
Suite 1970/0 → 1972/0.

**Owner decision (mid-slot).** Go further than #190: **full reflexion removal** —
replace reflect (WF2 4/9 + WF3), critique (WF1 + setup), and memorize (Step 10)
with in-repo prompts; use **mempalace** for memory instead of `reflexion:memorize`;
follow-up issue to migrate existing rawgentic memories to mempalace if required.
Sequenced as the next slot after #190 (kept out of #190 to preserve its narrow,
reviewed scope).

**Status.** PR #204 squash-merged `cd1fe1b`, v3.2.0, issue closed.

### #205 — remove the reflexion plugin dependency · v3.3.0 (owner-expanded from #190 P3)

**Issue.** Mid-#190 the owner asked: why still depend on reflexion at all? Investigation:
`/reflexion:reflect|critique|memorize` are prompt-only (a rubric behind a slash command;
no code we called) and fail open to *unreviewed* when the plugin is absent. Decision: full
removal + use mempalace for memory.

**What shipped.** An in-repo **quality-bar rubric** (`skills/*/references/quality-bar.md` —
skeptical-gatekeeper stance + depth triage + finding shape) replaces reflect/critique at every
gate: WF2 Steps 4/6/9/15, WF3, incident, and setup's config critique. Memorize (WF2 Step 10,
WF3, incident) curates into **mempalace** (`mcp__mempalace__*`) when available, falling back
to `CLAUDE.md`/`MEMORY.md` on absence **or store failure**. `critiqueMethod` deprecated/inert;
reflexion prerequisite, add-on row, and troubleshooting entry removed. No active skill invokes
`/reflexion:*` (drift-guarded).

**Reviews.** 2 opus reviewers (leftover + logic lenses), converging independently on the same
Medium: "reflect" was the retired skill's own name, so keeping it as the replacement's name
undercut the removal — swept WF2 §4/§6/§9 to "self-review" (WF3 keeps its consistent
"Lightweight Reflect" gate name). Also fixed: SKILL.md mandatory-steps stale "full critique"
tier, memorize store-failure fallback, and the quality-bar finding-shape override contract.
Security scan clean. Suite 1972/0 (2 red-first guards: reflexion-freedom + §4 quality-bar).

**Follow-up.** #206 — migrate existing rawgentic memories into mempalace if warranted.

**Status.** PR #207 squash-merged `f5786a3`, v3.3.0, issue closed.

### #191 — WF2 Step 1b always emits the /goal prompt · v3.4.0

**Issue.** #191 (P4): Step 1b skipped emitting the constructed `/goal` when a prior goal
might be active (observed on #162) — but a skill can't observe or set the session goal, so
the reliable behavior is to always emit.

**What shipped.** Step 1b ALWAYS emits the per-issue `/goal` prompt; it no longer suppresses
on the guess that a prior goal is active. Exception: under an epic campaign
(`RAWGENTIC_EPIC_GOAL` env set — the driver sets it, forward-declared for #192) it **defers**
to the active epic-level goal rather than clobbering it, logged `(deferred: epic #N)`. New
`deferred` value in the run-record `goal_guard` vocab. Reviewer flagged WF3 parity as a #192
follow-up (WF3 will need the same defer once epics drive its sub-issues).

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane. 1 opus: NO FINDINGS (item-4/5 coherent, vocab consistent
across steps.md/run-record.md/work_summary.py/README, forward-declaration honest, validation
fail-closed). red-first: goal_guard `deferred` + Step-1b always-emit drift guard. Scan clean.
Suite 1972/0 → 1974/0.

**Status.** PR #208 squash-merged `b132c51`, v3.4.0, issue closed.

### #192 — driver epic-level goal guard + tolerant escape clause · v3.5.0

**Issue.** #192 (P5, depends on #191): the `/goal` guard belongs at the epic/campaign
level, not per-issue — a per-issue goal lets the session quit after any single slot, and
same-session `/goal` overwrite is documented-unverified. And this campaign hit the stale-goal
failure directly (the goal fired relentlessly after each slot).

**What shipped.** `plan_lib.build_goal_text` gains a `campaign` variant enumerating an epic's
topo-ordered children into ONE goal (≤4000-char fallback), with a **tolerant escape clause**:
"a child closed not-planned per its own acceptance criteria counts as satisfied, and the owner
may pause the campaign at any time." `driver_lib.campaign_goal_text(state)` is the kickoff seam
(epic anchor + topo children; raises on missing epic / dependency cycle). The driver emits the
goal (owner-run — a skill can't self-set `/goal`) and exports `RAWGENTIC_EPIC_GOAL=<epic>`,
which WF2 **and** WF3 Step 1b defer to (the #191 contract, extended to fix-bug per its review).

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane (2 impl .py). 1 opus: 1 Medium (my changelog insertion garbled
a v3.4.0 line — fixed), everything else clean (cap enforced, no import cycle, epic guard rejects
bool, escape-clause wording consistent across code/doc/changelog, RAWGENTIC_EPIC_GOAL honestly
scoped as driver-set). red-first campaign + driver tests. Scan clean. Suite 1974/0 → 1984/0.

**Status.** PR #209 squash-merged `1b3b3fd`, v3.5.0, issue closed.

### #193 — WF1 decompose an over-large ask → epic + children · v3.6.0

**Issue.** #193 (P6): WF1 only *suggested* splitting an over-large ask and filed one issue —
enhance it to emit a driver-consumable epic + ordered children (the missing front-end for the
#163 epic/driver machinery).

**What shipped.** create-issue Step 1 detects over-large (≥3 shippable deliverables / many
concerns) and OFFERS to decompose (new Step 2c): an epic (`epic:` label + `- [ ] #N` task-list)
+ children with `Depends on #N` edges (`driver_lib.parse_depends_on` reads them). Hard approval
gate — the whole decomposition is presented and NOTHING is filed until "go"; children file in
topo order, epic last. Threshold: ≥3 → epic, 2 → cross-linked, 1 → single issue. Lean single-pass
+ inline quality-bar; opt-in WF5 for architectural asks.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane (prose). 1 opus: 1 Medium (partial-decomposition resumption gap
— <resumption> now records per-child + COMPLETE markers and resumes without re-filing) + 3 Low
(pre-approval label creation moved to filing; threshold-seam clarified; test pins `- [ ] #N`) —
all fixed. Driver-consumability verified against parse_depends_on + the epic task-list regex. Scan
clean. Suite 1984/0 → 1990/0.

**Status.** PR #210 squash-merged `4a54482`, v3.6.0, issue closed.

### #194 — reliable external skill/command use (probe + vendored-copy) · v3.7.0

**Issue.** #194 (P8+P10): nothing verified a built-in/plugin skill existed before a gate
relied on it (the #162 trap), and running an external command by hard cache path is brittle.
Build ONE primitive.

**What shipped.** `hooks/external_ref_lib.py`: `probe(kind, name)` (version-independent cache
lookup — numeric version sort, not lexicographic — reports exists/trusted; a miss is a VISIBLE
skip), `vendor_copy(...)` (durable gitignored copy + sha256-manifest refresh + retained
`vanished` alert), and a trust-gate (`is_trusted` + `RAWGENTIC_TRUSTED_MARKETPLACES`) because
an external command is third-party prompt content. CLI probe/vendor/is-trusted;
`docs/external-references.md`; `.rawgentic-vendored/` gitignored. First real consumer is #196.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane (new .py primitive). 1 opus: 2 Medium — lexicographic version
pick (3.10.0<3.9.0) → numeric sort; path-traversal via `name` → bare-name guard on probe+vendor
— both fixed with tests. Also caught + fixed two spliced changelog headings from earlier slots
and added a permanent garble drift guard. Scan clean. Suite 1990/0 → 2007/0.

**Status.** PR #211 squash-merged `f8d2252`, v3.7.0, issue closed.

### #195 — OAuth-first authenticated Action reviews; migrate #166 · v3.8.0

**Issue.** #195 (P12, folds P11): run reviews as GitHub Actions authenticated by subscription
OAuth first, API-key fallback. The dedicated `claude-code-security-review` action is API-key-only,
so route security review through `claude-code-action@v1` too.

**What shipped.** `.github/workflows/claude-security-review.yml` migrated off the API-key-only
action to `claude-code-action@v1` (SHA-pinned) running `/security-review`. Auth resolves
OAuth-first: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → visible skip (`executed=false`).
Non-blocking + 10-PR tally preserved; `executed=true` gated on the review actually succeeding.
Output shape doc-verified (inline PR comments via `classify_inline_comments`); live run
owner-gated. Owner setup + self-hosted zero-secret alternative in `docs/config-reference.md`.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane (CI yml). 1 opus: 2 Medium — missing `id-token: write` (the
action's default App-OIDC auth needs it) + `executed=true` emitted from secret-presence not
review-success — both fixed; 1 Low (inline posting doc-verified, owner-gated). AC3 honesty
confirmed. Scan clean. Suite 2007/0 → 2011/0.

**Status.** PR #212 squash-merged `36aa09a`, v3.8.0, issue closed.

### #196 — reopen #162: post-PR code-review via the Action · v3.9.0

**Issue.** #196 (P9, depends on #189 ✓ + #195 ✓): reopen the #162 review-switch with a mechanism
that works. `/code-review` can't be called from a skill, but claude-code-action@v1 can run it
post-PR (OAuth), capturing findings as `builtin_code_review` for the A/B #162 couldn't run.

**What shipped.** `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`: post-PR built-in `/code-review` via
claude-code-action@v1 (OAuth-first, draft-gated + `ready_for_review`, SHA-pinned, non-blocking) —
the candidate `builtin_code_review` arm running **additively** to WF2's hand-rolled Step 11 (coverage
never drops), which breaks #162's circular gate. With #189's telemetry, the AC4 A/B is now
**computable**; the #162 decision doc is reopened as "computable, pending owner-gated data." Capture
mechanism documented (run-records.md). WF5 diff pass unchanged.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane (CI yml). 1 opus: 1 Medium — draft-gate missing `ready_for_review`
trigger type (draft→ready transition wouldn't fire) — fixed + guarded; everything else clean
(additive verified, original ABANDONED record preserved, AC2/AC3 honestly scoped). Scan clean.
Suite 2011/0 → 2020/0.

**Status.** PR #213 squash-merged `35413a7`, CI green, suite 2020/0, issue closed
(backfilled by the #197 pass).

### #197 — official versioned workflow diagram · v3.10.0 — LAST epic-#188 slot

**Issue.** #197: the canonical, versioned workflow diagram — workflow-only view,
clickable per-phase drill-down, version history, committed to the repo. Separate from
the health/proposals overlay. Owner: build with Fable, award-grade showcase visual.

**What shipped.** `docs/workflow-diagram.html` — self-contained hash-routed SPA styled
as an engineering drafting document (title block, REV stamps as the version selector,
revision triangles Δ, loop-back return arcs; colored-ink vellum light / luminous
blueprint dark; embedded OFL fonts, zero external requests, DOM-builder rendering — no
`innerHTML`, test-enforced). Full 19-station WF2 drill-down (purpose, sub-steps, gate
facts, lane behavior per station) at REV 3.10.0 + the pre-campaign 3.1.0 snapshot
(SUPERSEDED stamp, per-station overrides incl. facts/lane); WF1 (7) / WF3 (15) / WF5
(5) skeletal phase sheets from their pinned skills. README embeds theme-aware
snapshots (`docs/assets/workflow-diagram-{light,dark}.png`, GitHub `<picture>`
pattern) linking to the interactive page; `docs/workflow-diagram.md` carries the
append-a-revision + snapshot-regeneration recipes; GitHub Pages (main + `/docs`)
serves it live once owner-enabled. Guarded by `tests/test_workflow_diagram.py`.

**Process.** Owner-gated design round: mockup approved after 3 rounds (drafting
concept → color enrichment per "too plain/too white-black" → WF1 tab first); final
artifact stored in `docs/` base per owner override of the AC4 `docs/planning/` path.

**Status.** PR #214 squash-merged `2fe2e0e`, CI green (incl. first live firing of the
#195/#196 Action review lanes), suite 2034/0. Issues #197 AND epic #188 closed —

## Slot 15 — #165: headless Action pilot · v3.1.0 — M4 crown, campaign capstone

**Issue.** #165 (M4): label-triggered headless WF2 on GA tooling
(claude-code-action v1), folding #48 (STATUS comments), #51 (large-PR warning),
#52 (progress guardrails). The overnight end-state: label an issue, get a PR.

**What shipped.**
- `.github/workflows/rawgentic-auto.yml`: `rawgentic:auto` label → headless
  `/rawgentic:implement-feature <n>`, PR-terminal. Job-level label gate,
  per-issue concurrency, `timeout-minutes: 120`, SHA-pinned action,
  subscription-OAuth secret by NAME, runner-local workspace bootstrap (WF2
  config-loading needs a workspace file; the checkout is the project repo),
  `plugins`/`plugin_marketplaces` from the repo's own PUBLIC marketplace —
  every external contract read from the action's own action.yml, not memory.
- `headlessEnabled` object shape: `{"enabled", "triggers", "auth"}` — fail-closed
  per-trigger allowlist against `RAWGENTIC_HEADLESS_TRIGGER` in session-start
  (jq verdict, 9 exotic inputs probed fail-closed), mirrored in `/switch` +
  setup Step 2c prose; auth-mode decision recorded per repo (AC5/AC7).
- STATUS comment type (#48): `format_status_comment()` + CLI `--type status` —
  non-blocking, metadata carries NO question_id so the resume path can never
  mistake it for a pending question; five step-boundary posts in headless.md.
- Large-PR warning (#51): Step-12 PR comment past `RAWGENTIC_LARGE_PR_FILES`
  (default 50, the issue's own default). Guardrails (#52): job timeout as the
  hard wall + STATUS heartbeat as the liveness signal.
- Suite 1936/0 → 1970/0 (34 new: 12 yml-structural, 9 shape, 5 STATUS,
  5 corpus drift guards proven red-on-old-prose, 3 hardening).

**Decisions (this slot).**
- Shape-extend `headlessEnabled` instead of adding a staged workspace field —
  keeps #184's setup↔manifest drift guard green by construction.
- Reduced fold scope named honestly: #48's machine-metadata AC descoped to
  free text; #51 interactive warning + #52 self-diagnosis design deferred.
- Never echo the trigger env value in the BLOCKED message (8a F1): the deny
  path writes to the model's instruction channel; any echo is an injection rider.

**Reviews.** Step 8a fired twice (T2 gate, T3 yml; 2 opus each): trigger-env
prompt-injection High fixed, concurrency/SHA-pin/label-approval-contract
hardening applied; **HIGH environmental finding — `main` had no branch
protection** (verified 404 + empty rulesets): ruleset creation was
permission-gated in-session, handed to owner as an exact command; **the pilot
must not go live before it.** Step 11 (2 opus): 1 Medium config-reference
field-table leftover (the #161 Critical's exact class — caught this time) +
threshold 25→50 correction; runtime reviewer probed the jq gate and bootstrap
end-to-end, no material findings. Security scan clean.

**Status.** PR + CI + merge SHA recorded post-merge this session. Live
end-to-end success metric (1 issue, zero touches) is owner-gated: repo secret
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (`claude setup-token`), the main-branch ruleset, then
label a real issue `rawgentic:auto`. Telemetry embedded below.

## Slot 14 — #161: v3.0.0 — six workflows removed, upgrade guide shipped

**Issue.** #161 (M3 capstone): bundle the 2.x breaking changes into one v3.0.0
boundary — one migration event for consumers instead of a drip.

**What shipped.**
- **BREAKING:** the six workflows deprecated at v2.60.0 (#160) are **removed** —
  `refactor` (WF4), `update-docs` (WF7), `update-deps` (WF8), `security-audit`
  (WF9), `optimize-perf` (WF10), `create-tests` (WF12) — plus their eval
  workspaces and their Codex-mirror symlinks; the marketplace `skills` whitelist
  drops 19 → 13. Zero STUB-FIRED telemetry across the deprecation cycle backed
  the verdict.
- `docs/upgrade-3.0.md` (AC1): replacement table (verified verbatim against the
  deleted stubs' own redirects), what-moved recap, cache-refresh steps, config
  notes — a removed name left in `adversarialReview.workflows` is inert
  (code-verified fail-closed membership matching).
- `tests/test_v3_removals.py` (23 red-first guards) replaces the stub drift
  guards: gone-stays-gone in BOTH trees, whitelist/description scrub, README
  body reference-freedom, guide presence.
- CHANGELOG: v3.0.0 entry **plus the missing v2.57.0–v2.66.0 backfill**
  (slot-13 follow-up closed; all 12 entries spot-checked against git by a
  reviewer — no drift).

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane, **lane-widened** honestly logged (real impl
count 146 vs estimate 4 — deletion mass, not new logic). Step 11 (2 opus):
**1 Critical, independently found by both reviewers** — the README's main SDLC
catalog table still advertised all six removed skills as invocable commands
(the removal sweep missed it and no test covered it); fixed + a red-first README
guard added. 2 Medium + 3 Low doc/manifest fixes. Adversarial diff review
mechanically skipped (no security surface). Security scan clean. Suite
1941/0 → 1936/0 (stub tests replaced by removal guards).

**Status.** PR #202 squash-merged `ea4e048`, v3.0.0, issue closed. CI green
(68s); AC3 verified via Mirror-to-STARS Action success @ea4e048 (evidence
comment on #161). **M3 COMPLETE.**

## Slot 13 — #184: version-aware setup prompt · v2.67.0

**Issue.** #184 (M3, epic #169): shipped opt-in features sit dark because
nothing tells users to re-run `/rawgentic:setup` after an upgrade — while the
existing post-update nudge re-nagged about the *same* unconfigured features on
**every** version bump. Fix: prompt only when the upgrade actually shipped a
setup-requiring feature.

**What shipped.**
- `hooks/post_update_reconcile.py` (the existing SECTION 2f mechanism — extended,
  not duplicated): `FEATURE_MANIFEST` entries gain `since` (the plugin version
  that introduced each setup step, verified against git history: headlessEnabled
  2.18.0 · adversarialReview 2.24.0 · modelRouting 2.46.0 · peerConsult 2.46.0 ·
  designArtifact 2.63.0) and the manifest expands 2 → 5 entries. needs-question
  nudges fire only when the reconciled-version jump crosses a `since`; an upgrade
  shipping nothing new bumps the marker **silently**.
- Numeric tuple version compare (never string compare); missing marker = fresh
  install = version zero; unparseable versions fail **open** toward prompting;
  `since`-less override entries keep legacy always-eligible semantics.
- Workspace top-level `"setupPrompt": false` opt-out — suppresses all output,
  still bumps the marker (lifting the opt-out prompts only on the next upgrade).
- Prompt now names the new feature(s) + affected projects, that setup preserves
  existing config, the no-re-nag guarantee, and the opt-out.
- **Drift guard (AC6):** manifest keys must equal the fields staged by setup
  SKILL.md's write-back sentence (anchored extraction, fail-loud), each with a
  valid `since` ≤ installed — a new setup opt-in step cannot ship without its
  manifest entry.

**Decisions (this slot).** Record-at-print marker semantics (a SessionStart hook
cannot observe accept/decline — the AC4 intent "same version never nags twice"
holds identically); workspace-level opt-out only (AC5's "per-project/workspace"
read as either-granularity; one kill-switch is the meaningful UX). Pre-existing
flaw named: README Changelog was missing v2.57.0–v2.66.0 entries — backfill
logged as a campaign follow-up. Between slots: #199 (PR #200, v2.66.0) shipped
the roadmap card style this log now renders with.

**Reviews.** Small-standard lane (1 impl file). Step 11: 2 opus reviewers, **0
Critical/High/Medium**; 3 Low (strict-boolean opt-out ruled working-as-designed
by both; one advisory test-completeness fix applied — the "won't repeat" wording
is now pinned). All 5 `since` values independently re-verified against git
history by reviewer 2. Adversarial diff review mechanically skipped (no security
surface). Security scan clean (iac/sca visible skips). Suite 1927/0 → 1941/0.

**Status.** *(backfilled by slot 14's pass)* PR #201 squash-merged `6c375b1`,
CI green, v2.67.0, issue closed. Telemetry embedded below.

## Slot 12 — #189: capture usage token/cost in run-records · v2.65.0

**Issue.** #189 (owner-promoted from fast-follow epic #188): the run-record `usage`
object existed (#155/#172) but nothing populated it — **null in all 24 records** —
so #162's yield-per-token gate was incomputable. Fix: capture real numbers + backfill,
with **non-vacuous** tests (AC5, explicitly "better than #155's schema-only tests").

**What shipped.**
- `hooks/usage_capture.py` — parses the Claude Code session transcript directly (same
  source as `ccusage`; stdlib-only, deterministic, no network). Sums per-model tokens
  into `model_mix` + totals + a rate-card cost, excludes the `<synthetic>` pseudo-model.
  `capture` (live, Step 16) + `backfill` (historical) subcommands, with a path-traversal
  guard on the session id and UTF-8-resilient reads (the current log may be mid-write).
- **Validator backstop** (`hooks/work_summary.py`) — `usage.capture_status` controlled
  vocab `{captured, unrecoverable, unavailable}`; a `captured` claim REQUIRES positive
  input + non-negative output, so the #155 null/zero-forever state can no longer persist.
- **Backfill applied** — the 12 historical usage rows carry no session-id correlator, so
  they are marked `unrecoverable` (honest per AC2; never silently null).
- Step 16 capture wiring documented + **pinned by a corpus drift-guard**; AC3 store
  drift-guard forbids any usage object with null/zero tokens and no marker.

**Non-vacuity (AC5).** Tests assert real-fixture known-value totals (865/90), end-to-end
capture, backfill against known values, and **red-before-green** guards for the
present-but-zero and zero-token-no-marker paths — the #155 failure mode in its new forms.

**Reviews.** Step 8a on both high-risk tasks caught **2 empirically-confirmed High** bugs
(non-vacuity guard checked block-count not token-sum = the #155 mode recurring; UTF-8
crash on a mid-write log) — both fixed. Step 11 (2 opus reviewers) caught **3 Medium**
(drift-guard zero-token blind spot; unpinned wiring; captured input=0) + 1 Low — all
fixed. Security scan clean (iac/sca visible skips).

**First real telemetry.** This slot's own run-record is the **first with non-null captured
tokens** (session-scoped — a documented granularity limitation). Suite 1907/0.

**Status.** *(backfilled by slot 13's pass)* PR #198 squash-merged `f6e2682`, CI
green, v2.65.0, issue closed. Telemetry embedded below.

## Slot 11 — #162: review switch — ABANDONED per AC4 data gate · v2.64.2

**Issue.** #162 (Step 4 reflect-only + Step 11 built-in /code-review + WF5 diff
pass) was **data-gated** by its own header ("no A/B evidence, no switch") and
AC4 ("matched hand-rolled yield over ≥10 runs at lower cost … otherwise abandon
this issue with the data cited").

**The data (23 run-records as of 2026-07-04).** The candidate arm
(`builtin_code_review`) has **0 gate-instances** — it never ran (≥10 required).
Token/cost telemetry (`usage.input_tokens`/`output_tokens`/`cost_estimate_usd`)
is **null in all 23 records**, so the success metric (findings-yield per token)
is incomputable for *any* arm. Incumbent arms: hand_rolled_multi 41 findings/11
gates · codex 16/4 · inline 19/13.

**Decision.** Abandon per AC4's explicit branch — a **deferral pending
telemetry, not a rejection** of built-in `/code-review` (Codex peer-consult
concurred). The roadmap's "the program is its own A/B" assumption was circular:
campaign runs could only generate candidate-arm data *after* the switch this
gate blocks. Reopen conditions: pilot built-in `/code-review` as an *additional*
Step 11 reviewer for ≥10 runs + backfill token telemetry. Full record:
`docs/measurements/2026-07-05-issue-162-data-gate-decision.md` (drift-guarded
by `tests/test_decision_records.py`, which recomputes the evidence basis from
`run_records.jsonl` records[:23]).

**What shipped.** Decision record + 3 drift-guard tests (one recomputes the
evidence from the store) · README/roadmap/dashboard annotations · v2.64.2.

**Owner directives (mid-slot).** #184 (version-aware setup prompt) inserted
into the campaign as **slot 12, before #161** — slots renumbered 12=#184,
13=#161, 14=#165; run doc, dashboard, roadmap updated.

**Reviews.** Step 11: opus reviewer (2 Low: citation + count fix, both applied)
+ Codex adversarial diff pass (2 Medium: drift-guard vacuity — test now parses
the store; applied). Security scan clean (iac/sca visible skips).

**Status.** *(backfilled by slot 13's pass)* decision-record PR #187
squash-merged `e7aadf7`, CI green, v2.64.2. Telemetry embedded below. Issue
closed as *not planned*, data cited.

## Slot 10 — #148 + #163: multi-issue driver (M3 start) · v2.64.0 <br>*(status backfill: PR #185 squash-merged `d7ea584`; post-merge hardening review → PR #186 `5e15862`, 7 findings fixed, v2.64.1, suite 1863/0)*

**Issues.** #148 (build the multi-issue driver as a documented pattern + queue
state schema, from design #134) and #163 (dependency-DAG + epic anchor,
schema v2) — implemented together in one PR (#163 extends #148's queue).

**What shipped.**
- `docs/multi-issue-driver.md` — the documented driver **pattern**: the loop
  (WF2 fresh per issue; advance on merge / `pr_open` when headless; park on
  DEFER), policy (order / deploy / review-budget / never-Haiku), the DEFER
  taxonomy + deterministic branch-preservation rule, the rollback-anchor
  protocol, the dependency-DAG ordering, the epic anchor, and the resumption
  reconciliation table (intra-WF2 resume delegated to `resume_lib`). Explicitly
  does **not** weaken WF2 — each iteration is a full run terminating at Step 16.
- `hooks/driver_lib.py` — the narrow, unit-tested DAG surface: `parse_depends_on`
  (word-boundary, negation-aware, sentence-bounded), `topo_sort_issues` (Kahn,
  fail-closed on cycle), `next_ready_issue` (deps-satisfied advance rule +
  `deps_satisfied_by` knob), `validate_driver_state` (v1/v2 readability +
  serial-active invariant), `validate_campaign_start` (headless-requires-epic).
  The fuller state-transition validator stays deferred (design #134 follow-up #2).
- `docs/driver-state/` — the git-tracked schema (`queue.schema.json`) + v1/v2
  example campaign files (live per-campaign state is disk-persisted under the
  gitignored `claude_docs/.driver-state/`).

**Decisions (this slot).**
- #163 DAG fork (Codex-consulted → option C): #148 stays pure-doc; #163 ships the
  *narrow* DAG helper only. Its algorithmic ACs ("cycles halt fail-closed",
  "0 ordering violations", "v1 readable") can't be verified as prose.
- "Committed" queue state reconciled with the gitignored `claude_docs/`: the
  live state file is *durably persisted to disk* (the resumption substrate); the
  git-tracked contract (schema + examples) lives in `docs/driver-state/`.

**Reviews.** Per-task 8a (2 reviewers) hardened `parse_depends_on` + fail-closed
number guards. Step-11 Codex diff review (owner-directed) applied 4 findings
(sentence-boundary parse, serial-active invariant, `validate_campaign_start`,
persist-topo-order-in-doc); concurrent Claude review reworded the overstated
"prompt-injection-safe" claim to an honest best-effort filter. Security scan
clean.

**Status.** PR + CI + merge SHA filled by the next slot's pass (established
convention). Telemetry for this slot is embedded below.
